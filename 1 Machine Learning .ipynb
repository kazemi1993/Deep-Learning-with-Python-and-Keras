You are given a dataset that contains data for house prices and a few features like number of bedrooms, size in square feet and age of the house. Let's see if you can build a model that is able to predict the price. In this exercise we extend what we have learned about linear regression to a dataset with more than one feature. Here are the steps to complete it:\n","\n","1. Load the dataset ../data/housing-data.csv\n","- plot the histograms for each feature\n","- create 2 variables called X and y: X shall be a matrix with 3 columns (sqft,bdrms,age) and y shall be a vector with 1 column (price)\n","- create a linear regression model in Keras with the appropriate number of inputs and output\n","- split the data into train and test with a 20% test size\n","- train the model on the training set and check its accuracy on training and test set\n","- how's your model doing? Is the loss growing smaller?\n","- try to improve your model with these experiments:\n","    - normalize the input features with one of the rescaling techniques mentioned above\n","    - use a different value for the learning rate of your model\n","    - use a different optimizer\n","- once you're satisfied with training, check the R2score on the test set"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"nDREy-EXIFez","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1749312346737,"user_tz":-210,"elapsed":4,"user":{"displayName":"Star","userId":"16069218276966640711"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["%matplotlib inline\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"metadata":{"id":"xbtaWv9_IJ7o","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1749312349177,"user_tz":-210,"elapsed":2443,"user":{"displayName":"Star","userId":"16069218276966640711"}},"outputId":"e6aa84ae-961f-4872-ebea-70b2da85b207"},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/drive;

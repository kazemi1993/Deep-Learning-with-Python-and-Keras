They've seen a lot of people leave the company recently and they would like to understand why that's happening. They have collected historical data on employees and they would like you to build a model that is able to predict which employee will leave next. The would like a model that is better than random guessing. They also prefer false negatives than false positives, in this first phase. Fields in the dataset include:\n","\n","- Employee satisfaction level\n","- Last evaluation\n","- Number of projects\n","- Average monthly hours\n","- Time spent at the company\n","- Whether they have had a work accident\n","- Whether they have had a promotion in the last 5 years\n","- Department\n","- Salary\n","- Whether the employee has left\n","\n","Your goal is to predict the binary outcome variable `left` using the rest of the data. Since the outcome is binary, this is a classification problem. Here are some things you may want to try out:\n","\n","1. load the dataset at ../data/HR_comma_sep.csv, inspect it with `.head()`, `.info()` and `.describe()`.\n","- Establish a benchmark: what would be your accuracy score if you predicted everyone stay?\n","- Check if any feature needs rescaling. You may plot a histogram of the feature to decide which rescaling method is more appropriate.\n","- convert the categorical features into binary dummy columns. You will then have to combine them with the numerical features using `pd.concat`.\n","- do the usual train/test split with a 20% test size\n","- play around with learning rate and optimizer\n","- check the confusion matrix, precision and recall\n","- check if you still get the same results if you use a 5-Fold cross validation on all the data\n","- Is the model good enough for your boss?\n","\n","As you will see in this exercise, the a logistic regression model is not good enough to help your boss. In the next chapter we will learn how to go beyond linear models.\n","\n","This dataset comes from https://www.kaggle.com/ludobenistant/hr-analytics/ and is released under [CC BY-SA 4.0
